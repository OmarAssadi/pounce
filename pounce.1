.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon
is a multi-client, TLS-only IRC bouncer.
It maintains a persistent connection to an IRC server
while allowing clients to connect and disconnect,
receiving messages that were missed upon reconnection.
Clients should use the IRCv3.2 server-time extension
to know when missed messages were received
and uniquely identify themselves by username.
.
.Pp
Options can be loaded from
files listed on the command line.
Each option is placed on a line,
and lines beginning with
.Ql #
are ignored.
The options are listed below
following their corresponding flags.

.
.Sh CAVEATS
One instance of
.Nm ,
and therefore one local port,
is required for each server connection.
.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon makes no distinction between channels.
Elevated activity in one channel
may push messages from a quieter channel
out of the buffer.
