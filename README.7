.Sh NAME
.Nm pounce
.Nd IRC pouncer :3
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Xr pounce 1
is a multi-client, TLS-only IRC bouncer.
It takes a simple approach,
using a multiple-consumer ring buffer
and the IRCv3.2
.Sy server-time
extension to communicate with clients.
.
.Sh RATIONALE
As a former
.Xr znc 1
user,
I was dissatisfied with the multi-client experience it offered.
I wanted to connect from both my laptop and my phone
and have full chat history on both.
With
.Xr znc 1 ,
my options were either having both clients
spammed with redundant history every time they connect,
or having one client consume the buffer
and the other get no history at all.
.
.Pp
With a multiple-consumer ring buffer,
each client has its own place in the history
and can be brought up to date independently.
Additionally,
by expecting clients to implement the
.Sy server-time
extension,
all events can be accurately replayed,
rather than being limited to messages.
.
.Sh INSTALLING
.Nm
requires LibreSSL
.Pq Fl ltls
and primarily targets
.Fx ,
where it is sandboxed with
.Xr capsicum 4 .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
make all
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local
.Ed
.
.Pp
On other systems,
such as macOS and Linux,
the build is configured using
.Xr pkg-config 1 .
If LibreSSL is installed
in a non-standard prefix,
set
.Ev PKG_CONFIG_PATH
appropriately.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/libressl/lib/pkgconfig ./configure
make all
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local
.Ed
