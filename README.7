.Sh NAME
.Nm pounce
.Nd IRC pouncer :3
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a multi-client, TLS-only IRC bouncer.
It takes a simple approach,
using a multiple-consumer ring buffer
and the IRCv3.2 server-time extension
to communicate with clients.

requires LibreSSL

.Sh RATIONALE
As a former
.Xr znc 1
user,
I was dissatisfied with the multi-client experience it offered.
I wanted to connect from both my laptop and my phone
and have full chat history on both.
With
.Xr znc 1 ,
my options were either having both clients
spammed with redundant history every time they connect,
or having one client consume the buffer
and the other get no history at all.
.
.Pp
With a multiple-consumer ring buffer,
each client has its own place in the history
and can be brought up to date independently.
Additionally,
by expecting clients to implement the server-time extension,
all events can be accurately replayed,
rather than being limited to messages.
